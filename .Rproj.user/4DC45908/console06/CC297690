warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

conda --help
usage: conda [-h] [-V] command ...

conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.

Options:

positional arguments:
  command
    clean        Remove unused packages and caches.
    config       Modify configuration values in .condarc. This is modeled
                 after the git config command. Writes to the user .condarc
                 file (/Users/jwatts/.condarc) by default.
    create       Create a new conda environment from a list of specified
                 packages.
    help         Displays a list of available conda commands and their help
                 strings.
    info         Display information about current conda install.
    install      Installs a list of packages into a specified conda
                 environment.
    list         List linked packages in a conda environment.
    package      Low-level conda package utility. (EXPERIMENTAL)
    remove       Remove a list of packages from a specified conda environment.
    uninstall    Alias for conda remove. See conda remove --help.
    search       Search for packages and display associated information. The
                 input is a MatchSpec, a query language for conda packages.
                 See examples below.
    update       Updates conda packages to the latest compatible version. This
                 command accepts a list of package names and updates them to
                 the latest versions that are compatible with all other
                 packages in the environment. Conda attempts to install the
                 newest versions of the requested packages. To accomplish
                 this, it may update some packages that are already installed,
                 or install additional packages. To prevent existing packages
                 from updating, use the --no-update-deps option. This may
                 force conda to install older versions of the requested
                 packages, and it does not prevent additional dependency
                 packages from being installed. If you wish to skip dependency
                 checking altogether, use the '--force' option. This may
                 result in an environment with incompatible packages, so this
                 option must be used with great caution.
    upgrade      Alias for conda update. See conda update --help.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version  Show the conda version number and exit.
