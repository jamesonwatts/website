# Biography

I teach, consult, and do research at the intersection of marketing and computer science with an emphasis on machine learning, computational linguistics and social networks. I have over 20 years of programming experience, which I employ in the service of research and the application of common data science tools to real-world business problems. My work has been published in the Journal of Interactive Marketing, Network Science, the International Journal of Market Research, the Journal of Business Research, Marketing Theory, and a book on digital marketing. My current research is focused on the use of semantic relatedness in digital advertising and recommendation engines.
