abstract = "Social interaction has always shaped consumer behaviour. People look to their friends for shopping advice (Feick and Price 1987), modify their food selections based on those sitting across from them at the restaurant (McFerran et al. 2010), and choose clothing in anticipation of how others will react (Chan et al. 2012). Social media, like Facebook and Twitter, have placed social interactions front and center in the minds of organizations. These platforms do not just let organizations monitor interactions between consumers; they allow them to participate in these conversations like never before. In light of their new role as active participants, organizations need new frameworks that can help guide their interactions with consumers over social media (Mangold and Faulds 2009, Kaplan and Haenlein 2010, Keitzmann et al. 2011)."
