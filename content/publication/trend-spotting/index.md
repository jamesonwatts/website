abstract = "As marketers, we are confronted by an increasingly complex worldâ€”one characterized by markets that emerge and evolve at an unprecedented rate. This has led to an increased need for methods that can help researchers translate this complexity and dynamism into actionable intelligence. In the current work, I introduce one such method, and show how it can be applied to the emergence and evolution of the biotechnology industry during the 1990s and early 2000s. I conclude with a discussion of how this method can be applied more broadly to areas like content marketing, trend spotting, and the interface between qualitative and quantitative market research."
